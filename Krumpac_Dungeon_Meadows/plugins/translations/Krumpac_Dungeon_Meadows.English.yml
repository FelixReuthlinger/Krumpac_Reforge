Krump_Dung_Meadows_Neck_Cave_Lore : "As the years passed, the small pond yielded fewer fish, and the fisherman struggled to provide enough for his family's survival. One spring day, as the fisherman was leaving his modest oak house, he met the Nokken. The creature offered him bountiful catches on the condition that the fisherman give him his beautiful daughter on the first day of her 18th year.The desperate fisherman agreed and promised Nøkken his daughter.The Nøkken kept his word, and laid fresh catches on the shore of the pond every morning. Week after week, year after year, the fisherman and his family prospered in health and in spirit. But all the while, the father lived in the shadow of his grim promise.On the fated morning of her 18th birthday, her father sent his daughter to the neck pond to bring the fish bucket.So she went down to the pond to bring the bucket home, unaware of the agreement between the creature and her father. The Nokken lay in wait, eager to reap his reward.The Nøkken asked her to go down to his watery abode to get the catches.Eager to obey her father, she reluctantly went into the neck cave.As she entered the mouth of the cave, the Nøkken began to laugh- a deep and horrible sound.He slammed the gate behind her and shouted in an inhuman voice:  Now you are MINE!Her fear turned to panic as the creature smiled, revealing rows of razor sharp teeth.Yet in that moment, she found her courage. She pulled out a knife and with steel in her voice, stated calmly that he would never have her alive.Then she plunged the knife into her heart and fell into the lake.And so her lifeblood dyed the water lilies red, and from that day on the sea flowers shone in a deep and terrible crimson."
